## How to Contribute

### Contributor Behavior

Be kind to one another. We're striving to make [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) an inclusive
environment that's great for first time open-source contributors.

Conventional Commits use the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) as main versioning workflow

### Setup Development Environment

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

```bash
# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/davidleonmayor/digital-least-squares-calculator.git

# or SSH
git clone git@github.com:davidleonmayor/digital-least-squares-calculator.git
```

3. Install the dependencies.

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application.

```bash
  python main.py
```

### Pull Requests

3. Create a new branch for each feature, fix or improvement.
4. Send a pull request from each feature branch to **main** branch.
